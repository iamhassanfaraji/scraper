**Objective:**

One of the projects I wanted to do someday was scraping, and I was looking for suitable conditions to do it!

Before starting this project, I had started another project that needed dummy data, and unfortunately, the available sites and tools did not have the necessary quality, especially for Persian languages.

So I took this opportunity to do this project.

This project helps you to learn how to use Puppeteer to:

1. Crawl a spa site and collect data
2. Identify the challenges you may face
3. Provide a lot of ready-made code to organize and sort the collected data.
